> A Vue.js project

### Notes & Todo:
Is working to most specifications. Most of app is static and not dynamic.  Used bulma for simplicity but I think it might be better to use bootstrap or bourbon.
- TODO: Implement vue-router and axios for routing and http calls
- TODO: Refactor commonly called functions and common css to global.
- TODO: Use sass instead of straight css.  Webpack would not recognize sass and in interest of time built in css for now.



#### Built using:
- vue-cli webpack template
- bulma CSS
- font-awesome
- normalize.css
- moment.js
